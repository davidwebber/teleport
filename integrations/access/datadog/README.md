# Teleport Datadog Incident Management Plugin

The Teleport Access API provides a simple Datadog Incident Management Plugin that
creates incidents in Datadog when a access request is created. You can find the
Teleport Access API in the main Teleport repository and the Datadog access
request plugin in `github.com/gravitational/teleport/integrations/access/datadog`.
